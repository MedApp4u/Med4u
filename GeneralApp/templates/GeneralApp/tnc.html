						<br><center><h3>PRIVACY POLICY</h3></center>

						<!-- <p class="termsncond"> -->Introduction: Advanstar is concerned about your privacy. We want you to understand what personal and personally identifiable information ("personal information") we collect about you, and how we use your personal information. The nature of the Services that we provide through our Web Site requires that we collect and use personal information about you as more fully described below. Some of your personal information may be disclosed to third parties (for example, accrediting bodies) in order to provide the Information and services that you request, and may be used by both Advanstar and third parties to provide that Information and/or perform those Services. In addition, Advanstar and third parties may use your personal information to offer you additional information, products or services that match your areas of interest.

						<br>How we collect personal information: When you register on our Web Site, we will ask you for certain personal information such as, for example, your address, telephone number, and e-mail address. If you send correspondence to the Web Site, such as e-mails, send correspondence to Advanstar such as letters, or if other users or third parties such as businesses send us communications about your activities in connection with your use of the Web Site, Advanstar has the right to retain and use that information. We will treat all of those communications in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

						<br>>Cookies: The Web Site employs mechanisms which automatically track certain information about you based upon your behavior while visiting the Web Site. This information is used to better understand and serve you by responding to your particular interests. This information may include, but is not limited to, the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that you came from (whether this URL is on the Web Site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the Web Site or not), what browser you are using, your screen size, your computer's operating system, referring/exit pages, date/time stamp, Internet protocol (IP) address, Internet service provider (ISP) name, and where your computer is located. We store that information on our and our service providers' computers, and in a "cookie", which is a small data file we create and store on your computer. The information in the cookie is accessed by the Web Site when you sign in, and helps us to enhance and personalize your experience when using the Site. Most websites on the Internet use cookies for this purpose. Most browsers allow you to turn off or limit cookies. Your browser is probably set to accept cookies, but if it is not then you should reconfigure it to do so, otherwise some of our features or services may not function properly as a result. We never provide advertisers or third parties with access to our cookies. Please note that Advanstar cannot track and is not responsible for cookies placed on your computer by advertisers or third parties.

						<br>How we use personal information: We use the personal information you provide through the registration process: to provide you with the Information and services you request; to communicate with you on matters relating to the Web Site and your account; to provide necessary information to the accrediting bodies and other of our affiliates in connection with the Information and Services you request from us; and to provide you with information about related services and/or products. You may choose to disclose or not disclose the personal information we request during the registration process. However, if you choose not to disclose the requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some or all of the Information or services you request.

						<br>We share your personal information with Advanstar's affiliates and partners and third parties licensed to access your personal information by any of the foregoing. We reserve the right to rent e-mail lists compiled from e-mail addresses gathered from this Web Site. We sometimes provide aggregated usage or tracking information collected from this website to third parties. We may also provide certain of your personal information to third parties that provide services to us in operating the Web Site or our businesses, such as account services, web hosting, software development and information processing. If you do not wish to receive certain communications from the Web Site, you have the ability to opt out by declining the service offered or informing us that you no longer wish to receive such communications. The opt-out feature and instructions for its use are available on the Web Site. We will comply with your request unless such communications are necessary for the administration of your account, required by law, or necessary to protect our rights.

						<br>Besides using information to provide our services, the Web Site uses information maintained about you, and other information obtained from your current and past activities to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our rights. At times, Advanstar may review the information of multiple users to identify problems or to resolve disputes.

						<br>Disclosing personal information: Advanstar uses commercially reasonable efforts to limit disclosures of your personal information. We may disclose your personal information to accrediting organizations and other third parties that we work with to the extent necessary to provide the Information and Services you request through Modern Medicine, and/or to provide you with related information, to communicate with you, and to provide you with information on other products and services in your areas of interest.

						<br>Technical and legal circumstances beyond our control could prevent Advanstar from ensuring that your information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described herein. For example, among other things, we may be required by law, regulation or court order to disclose personal information to government representatives or third parties under certain circumstances. If Advanstar is requested by law enforcement officials or judicial authorities to provide personal information, Advanstar may, without your consent, provide such personal information. In matters involving claims of personal or public safety or in litigation where the data is pertinent, Advanstar may use or disclose your personal information without your consent or court process. Unauthorized parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions despite any commercially reasonable security efforts by Advanstar. You acknowledge that despite the use of such technology, no website is 100% secure. Further, corporate restructuring, sale of assets, merger, divestiture and other changes of control or financial status affecting Advanstar may require disclosure as an incidental result of a transfer of assets by operation of law or otherwise, and the consummation of a sale, merger, bankruptcy or liquidation transaction involving Advanstar or certain of its affiliates or business divisions could require the sale, assignment or transfer of your personal information to a purchaser or Advanstar's successor in interest. Therefore, Advanstar and affiliates do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information shall remain private or under the sole control of Advanstar under all circumstances.

						<br>Your rights: You may at any time print, download, or request in writing a printed copy of these terms and conditions including the Privacy Policy set forth herein. You may at any time, by writing to Advanstar, request a copy of the personally identifiable information we have collected about you through this Web Site, and may request corrections or updates to that information. Advanstar will make reasonable efforts to respond promptly to all such requests, but reserves the right to limit such requests to two per year per individual.

						<br>If you have any questions that are not answered elsewhere on this site, if you would like to review the personally identifiable information we have collected about you, or if you believe that this policy has been violated, please contact us. Our response to such inquiries may be limited to information under our direct control.

						<br>This privacy policy only applies to information collected by the Web Site. Any information you provide to, or that is collected by, Third-Party Sites may be subject to the privacy policies of those sites, if any. It is the sole responsibility of such third parties to adhere to any applicable restrictions on the disclosure of your personal information, and Advanstar and affiliates shall not be liable for wrongful use or disclosure of your personal information by any third party.

						<br>Information on Children: As a business-to-business company, we do not knowingly collect information from children. On-line registration and web site usage is restricted to adults who are professionally engaged in the businesses we serve.
